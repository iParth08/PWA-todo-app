```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/super-todo.git
cd super-todo
# Just open index.html in your browser!
````

## ⚙️ Enable PWA Support

1. Add a simple `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Super Todo",
  "short_name": "Todo",
  "start_url": "./index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#4CAF50",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Register a `service worker` in `script.js`:

```js
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("./sw.js")
      .then((reg) => console.log("Service Worker Registered ✅", reg))
      .catch((err) => console.error("Service Worker Error ❌", err));
  });
}
```

3. Example `sw.js`:

```js
const CACHE_NAME = "super-todo-v1";
const urlsToCache = ["/", "/index.html", "/style.css", "/script.js"];

self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches
      .match(event.request)
      .then((response) => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});
```
